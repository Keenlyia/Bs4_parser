# Product Scraper 
This product scraper is a Python script that fetches data from a given product page on the Rozetka website. It extracts key information about the product (such as title, color, memory, price, etc.), and saves the results in an Excel file for later use.

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
